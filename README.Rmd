**StructuralDecompose** is an algorithm suited to the decomposition of a time series into its component terms of trend, seasonality, and residuals. It is well suited to decompose a series in the presence of significant level shifts.

The algorithm outputs the decomposed trend, seasonality, residuals, as well as anomalies detected.
