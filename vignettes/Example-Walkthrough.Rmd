# Introduction
In this example, we will go through the various features of StructuralDecompose. We will trace it's behavior with the popular 'Nile Dataset' that tracks the annual flow of the Nile river. This dataset has a single break-point in the series. We will test our algorithm against other common trend fitting algorithms as well.


# Getting Started 
StructuralDecompose primarily relies on 'Strucchange' and 'changepoints' for the detection of breakpoints. Other packages will be added soon. Currently the smoothening algorithm defaults to loess, but we will add further smoothening algorithms in the future. 


```{r libraries}
library(changepoint)
library(strucchange)
```


# Loading the Data
To read the data we can use the simple: 

```{r Data Loading}
data <- StructuralDecompose::Nile_dataset[,1]
```

Let's see the movement of the data over time 

```{r Base data visualization}
matplot(data, type = 'l', xlab = 'Years', ylab = 'Annual Flow of the Nile (10^8 m^3')
```

There is a sudden level shift within the data, let's see decompose with simple stl and see how well the data movement is captured. 

```{r stl decomposition}
data <- StructuralDecompose::Nile_dataset[,1]

data = ts(data = as.vector(t(data)), frequency = 2)

decomposed <- stl(data, s.window = 'periodic')

seasonal <- decomposed$time.series[,1]
trend <- decomposed$time.series[,2]
remainder <- decomposed$time.series[,3]
```
# Decomposition
Let's decompose the time series into parts and observe it's behavior 

```{r stl plotting all}
plot(cbind(seasonal, remainder, trend), type = 'l', main = 'Decomposed Series')
```

As we can see the trend overexplains the time series 

```{r Start of the function}
matplot(cbind(trend, data), type = 'l', xlab = 'Years', ylab = 'Annual Flow of the Nile (10^8 m^3', main = 'Trend vs Base Data')
```
As we can see the trend overexplains the time series
