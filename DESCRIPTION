Description: Explains the behaviour of a time series by decomposing it into its trend, seasonality and residuals. 
             It is built to perform very well in the presence of significant level shifts. It is designed to play 
             well with any breakpoint algorithm and any smoothening algorithm. Currently defaults to lowess for smoothening
             and strucchange for breakpoint identification. The package is useful in
             areas such as trend analysis, time series decomposition, changepoint detection and anomaly detection.
